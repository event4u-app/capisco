/**
 * Agent Client Protocol (ACP) transport contract (B3 Phase 1, concept §4.1).
 *
 * "Empfehlung: ACP als Transport übernehmen, bevor irgendeine Agent-Anbindung
 * selbst gebaut wird." ACP is JSON-RPC over stdio (local) where the IDE mediates
 * file / terminal / tool access. The IDE is the *client*; the agent CLI (Claude
 * Code, Codex, Gemini …) is the *server* it spawns. We model the subset the
 * micro-north-star needs:
 *
 *  Client → Agent (requests, id-bearing):
 *    - `session/new`    → start a run; resolves a `sessionId`.
 *    - `session/prompt` → send the user/ToDo prompt into a run.
 *
 *  Agent → Client (requests the IDE must mediate — this is the broker seam):
 *    - `session/request_permission` → the agent asks to perform a tool/shell/
 *      file/net action. The IDE routes EVERY one through the capability broker
 *      (B4) and answers allow/deny. The agent CANNOT act around it — there is no
 *      direct fs/shell method on the client surface, only this gated request.
 *
 *  Agent → Client (notifications, id-less):
 *    - `session/update` → token deltas, tool-call records, status, telemetry.
 *
 * These map 1:1 onto the streaming surface in `contracts/agents.ts`
 * ({@link SessionEvent}) — the transport adapter (Phase 1) translates ACP
 * `session/update` notifications into `SessionEvent`s on the subscribe channel
 * and persists them into the {@link SessionStore}.
 *
 * DEFERRED: a real ACP agent CLI + LLM key is a thin swap — the same JSON-RPC
 * frames flow over the child process's stdio. The build tests against a
 * deterministic `stub-acp-agent.mjs` (scripted stdio), so CI never needs a real
 * agent or an API key.
